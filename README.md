# FirebaseJSChat
A simple chat based on the Firebase Realtime Database by Google

Access the chat by going to https://firejschat.web.app/

The chat currently has 3 chat rooms, with the ability to add chat rooms, which is currently broken.
Messages sent by the user are now in blue text, while other messages are in black text.

Using the chat is simple:

  1) Choose a chat room
  
  2) Enter a usn and a message and press send or press the Enter key
  
  3) Both Usn and message can be changed at anytime
  
  
Future plans for this project are adding anonymous string based usernames rather than anonymous number based usernames, adding styling, and accounts.
