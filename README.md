# FirebaseJSChat
A simple chat based on the Firebase Realtime Database by Google

Access the chat by going to https://presidential-29357.web.app/

The chat currently has 3 chat rooms, with a future plan of either more rooms created by me, or the option to create rooms by users
Using the chat is simple:
  1)Choose a chat room
  2)Enter a usn and a message and press send or press the Enter key
  3)Both Usn and message can be changed at anytime
Future plans for this project are to add more rooms (either by me or an option for users to create rooms), adding anonymous chatting (perhaps by using the clients system time), make it look better with CSS, and accounts
