# FirebaseJSChat
A simple chat based on the Firebase Realtime Database by Google

Access the chat by going to https://firejschat.web.app/

The chat currently has 3 chat rooms, with the ability to add/join chat rooms using a room key.
Messages sent by the user are now in blue text, while other messages are in black text.

Using the chat is simple:

  1) Choose a chat room

  2) Enter a message and press send or press the Enter key
  
The chat room can be changed at anytime, the page will simply refresh once a new one is chosen from the dropdown menu or a new room key is entered.

As of right now, the room name is displayed on top of the screen, or the room key. 

Future plans for this project are adding anonymous string based usernames rather than anonymous number based usernames, adding styling, and accounts.
